Welcome to NobleAI Reactor. 

With Reactor, you'll be able to accelerate your work using AI models to design novel materials and chemical formulations. In this demonstration, we will guide you through the process of using AI models to guide the formulation of sustainable concrete.

Today, the manufacture of concrete is responsible for 8% of global carbon emissions with global demand expected to increase to 6.2bn tons by 2050.1 To combat global warming, your team (Sustainable Concrete LLC.), is developing a new concrete formulation that produces less CO2 while also maintaining its strength and is cost-effective to produce.

A typical concrete formulation contains seven ingredients: cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, blast furnace slag, fly ash, superplasticizer, and water (with relative ratios as shown in the figure below).
